# Set the PIN length for Audio Conferencing meetings in Skype for Business Online

[!INCLUDE [sfbo-retirement](../../Hub/includes/sfbo-retirement.md)]


> [!NOTE]
> For information about setting the PIN length in Microsoft Teams, see [Set the PIN length for Audio Conferencing meetings in Microsoft Teams](/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/Set-the-PIN-length-for-Audio-Conferencing-meetings-in-teams).

When you're setting up audio conferencing for Skype for Business, you'll get an audio conferencing bridge. A conferencing bridge can contain one or more phone numbers. The phone number you set will be included on the meeting invites for the Skype for Business app.
  
The audio conferencing bridge answers a call for people who are dialing in to a meeting using a phone. It answers the caller with voice prompts from an auto attendant and then, depending on your settings, can play notifications and ask callers to record their name. **Microsoft bridge settings** allow you to change the settings for meeting notifications and the meeting join experience, and set the length of the PINs that are used by meeting organizers. Meeting organizers use PINs to start meetings if they can't join the meeting using the Skype for Business app.

## Setting the PIN length
 
1. In the **Skype for Business admin center**, in the left navigation, go to **Audio conferencing** > **Microsoft bridge settings**.
    
2. Under **Security** > **PIN length**, select the number of digits you want for the PIN, and then click **Save**.
    
> [!NOTE]
> A PIN is different from a conference ID. Conference IDs are used by callers when they join the meeting. They are used to identify the meeting. The PIN is used to authenticate a caller as the meeting organizer. 

## Want to know more about PIN settings?

- PINs can be from 4 to 12 digits; the default is 5. Numbers are only used when creating PINs. Letters and special characters aren't used.
    
- A PIN is only required for the meeting organizer when a Skype for Business user hasn't already started the meeting. If everyone is dialing in to the meeting, then the PIN is required for the meeting organizer to start the meeting.
    
- PIN security settings are applied to all of the phone numbers that are associated with a Microsoft bridge. They will be applied to all meetings that use the phone numbers associated with a given bridge. 
    
## Want to know how to manage with Windows PowerShell?

- To save time or automate this, you can use the [Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings](/powershell/module/skype/Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings) cmdlet.
    
- To set the number of digits in the PIN to 8:  `Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings -PinLength 8`
    
- Windows PowerShell is all about managing users and what users are allowed or not allowed to do. With Windows PowerShell, you can manage Microsoft 365 or Office 365 using a single point of administration that can simplify your daily work when you have multiple tasks to do. To get started with Windows PowerShell, see these topics:
    
  - [Why you need to use Microsoft 365 or Office 365 PowerShell](/microsoft-365/enterprise/why-you-need-to-use-microsoft-365-powershell)
    
  - [Best ways to manage Microsoft 365 or Office 365 with Windows PowerShell](/previous-versions//dn568025(v=technet.10))
    
- Windows PowerShell has many advantages in speed, simplicity, and productivity over only using the Microsoft 365 admin center, such as when you are making settings changes for many users at one time. Learn about these advantages in the following topics:

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Windows PowerShell module for Skype for Business Online enables you to create a remote Windows PowerShell session that connects to Skype for Business Online. This module, which is supported only on 64-bit computers, can be downloaded from the Microsoft Download Center at [Download and install the Teams PowerShell module](../set-up-your-computer-for-windows-powershell/download-and-install-the-skype-for-business-online-connector.md).
